Code changes
------------

(i) Two new keys need to be created, PDA_COMP_CODE and PDA_ITEM.
These are akin to the AV_COMP_CODE and AV_ITEM codes but have "PDA" as
there value rather than "AV".

(ii) Two new keys need to be created, PDA_WARDEN_ROLE and PDA_INSPECTOR_ROLE.
They have defaults of "pda-tw" and "pda-in" respectively.

(iii) Created a new key PDA_RELAXED_SEARCH to allow Wandsworth Housing to be
able to search their schedules/complaints by entering the building_name.
