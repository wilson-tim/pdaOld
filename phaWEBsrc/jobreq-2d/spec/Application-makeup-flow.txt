Descriptions of the files used in the application:

[reqform.jsp]
This is the initial page which the user logs a fault on. If the user does not
correctly enter all the information, they are sent back to this screen with the
errors highlighted.

[controller.jsp]
This page checks the users input, updates the database (via the
pharaoh.web.databases package), sends an email and
redirects the user to either the [reqform.jsp], [newreq.jsp] or the
[dataexpired.jsp] form.

[newreq.jsp]
This page shows the user the reference number for the job they have just
entered, and allows them to enter a new request.

[dataexpired.jsp]
This page tells the user they have tried to store the same job they have just
stored and that they should enter a new request.

[error.jsp]
This is the error page which tells the users things like the database closed
etc.

(style-include.jsp)
This sets the styles for the [faultform.jsp] and [newfault.jsp] pages, and is
included with a jsb include flag.

(footer-inlcude.jsp)
This sets the footer for the [faultform.jsp] and [newfault.jsp] pages, and is
included with a jsb include flag.

(pharaoh-arrow-web.gif)
This is the arrow used for a new request.

(pharaoh-globe-web.gif)
This is the pharaoh globe used in the (footer-include.jsp) file.
