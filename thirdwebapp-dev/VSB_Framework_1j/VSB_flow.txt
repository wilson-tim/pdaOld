JSP WEB Application flow and Overview:

Using the VSB (View Script Bean) Stucture:

                        ________________
                       |      VIEW      |<-----------------------+
       +---------------| <form>View.jsp |________                |
       |               |________________| SCRIPT |---<invalid>---+
       |                 |   <form>Script.jsp    |------------<valid>--------->The next formScript
       |  +--------------|_______________________|------+
       |  |                                             |
       |  |                                             |
       |  |               _________________             |
       |  +--USE(R/W)-->>|     STORAGE     |            |
       |                 | <form>Bean.java |<<---INIT---+
       +-----USE(R)---->>|_________________|


KEY:
---<condition>--->   Moves to the next form when the <condition> is true.
---INIT--->>         Initializes the bean.
---USE(<type>)--->>  Uses the bean. The type of use is defined as:
                       R - Read Only
                       W - Write Only
                       R/W - Read and Write

See the VSB_Structure.txt file for more information about the VSB structure and flow.


Following is a map of the pages for the jobreq webapp:

<...> This is not a page or form, but just a functional route, or note.
(...) This is a normal JSP page
[...] This is a VSB form
--->  The lines indicate the flow of control in the application. With the vertical
      lines if in doubt of the direction of flow it will be downward.
